# Create a spice testbench and simulate
To generate a SPICE testbench for verifying the behavior of the SPICE netlist generated from your layout, you'll need to follow these steps. This process involves creating a SPICE file that sets up the simulation environment, applies input signals, and defines the measurements to be taken. Below is a guide and example of how to create a SPICE testbench.
