# Layout Design using Magic VLSI#
Creating the physical layout of the CMOS inverter is essential for fabrication and further analysis process. In this section, we are going to do layout designing and DRC handling, spice generation of layout and LVS checking using NETGEN.

## Structure of the CMOS ##
Before moving into layout design we have to get some idea about the physical structure of a CMOS transistor in Silicon level. It includes key structures like diffusion areas, gate oxides, polysilicon gates, metal layers and vias etc.
