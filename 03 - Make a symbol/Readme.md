## Making a symbol for the inverter and VTC analysis ##
Here we save our inverter as a separate component. In this process after the schematic press 'a' to save it as a symbol. By pressing 'e' and ctrl+e you can edit and exit the internals of the symbol. After that, we can move into  the Voltage Transfer Characteristic (VTC) analysis of the inverter.
