## Delay Analysis

Delay analysis is a critical aspect of VLSI design, impacting the performance and reliability of the circuit. In this project, we focus on the following types of delays:

### Propagation Delay

Propagation delay (\( t_{pd} \)) is the time taken for a signal to travel from the input to the output of the inverter. Specifically, it is measured from the point where the input signal reaches 50% of its final value to the point where the output signal reaches 50% of its final value.

### Rise Time and Fall Time

- **Rise Time (\( t_r \))**: The time taken for the output signal to rise from 10% to 90% of its final value.
- **Fall Time (\( t_f \))**: The time taken for the output signal to fall from 90% to 10% of its final value.
